# COVID-19 Vaccine Data Visualization Using Tableau

This repository contains a data visualization project that explores the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines across different countries. The project analyzes the number of people who have been partially and fully vaccinated, and the percentage of those who haven't been vaccinated yet. Additionally, it looks at the correlation between vaccination rates and GDP.

## Project Overview

This Tableau dashboard presents:
- The total number of people partially vaccinated globally.
- The percentage of people not yet vaccinated.
- Vaccination progress across countries (comparison between partially and fully vaccinated individuals).
- Vaccination rates vs GDP per capita.



## Key Features
- Real-time analysis of vaccine distribution across countries.
- Visual comparison of vaccinated vs. fully vaccinated individuals in each country.
- GDP versus vaccination rates scatter plot to highlight economic factors.

## Data Source
The data used for this project was sourced from publicly available COVID-19 datasets on [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?kuid=d948c3e2-d212-4e8b-b29f-88e06e2ffb08&lid=84619].
